Project Roaster
===============
> Automatically grades _your_ code!

[Roast](https://roast.software) analyzes and grades your code. The user can
register and follow their personal programming progress and compare it with
friends! You could compare it to music scrobbling, but for code.

Personal statistics is generated by running static code analysis on the uploaded
code - data such as number of errors, what type of errors and even code style
problems is collected. The statistics can then be viewed in a feed where both
your own and your friends progress is listed.

Global statistics like most common errors and number of rows analyzed is
displayed on a page that can be viewed by everyone.

## Development guidelines
### Lint and format
Before you commit, the affected files should be run through `goimports`. Bonus: Also run `go vet`.

 * goimports: `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports`

### Tests
Write tests for everything.

### Branches
Develop inside your own branch until you're done, then send a pull request.

### Commits
Commits should be formatted with primary affected package as prefix, a short descriptive one liner and then an optional description of the context and what the change does. Also use GitHub's `Fixes #123` feature for closing issues. All commits must be signed with GPG.

Example:
```
math: improve Sin, Cos and Tan precision for very large arguments

The existing implementation has poor numerical properties for
large arguments, so use the McGillicutty algorithm to improve
accuracy above 1e10.

The algorithm is described at http://wikipedia.org/wiki/McGillicutty_Algorithm

Fixes #159
