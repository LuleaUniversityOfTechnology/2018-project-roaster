Project Roaster
===============
> Automatically grades _your_ code!

[Roast](https://roast.software) analyzes and grades your code. The user can
register and follow their personal programming progress and compare it with
friends! You could compare it to music scrobbling, but for code.

Personal statistics is generated by running static code analysis on the uploaded
code - data such as number of errors, what type of errors and even code style
problems is collected. The statistics can then be viewed in a feed where both
your own and your friends progress is listed.

Global statistics like most common errors and number of rows analyzed is
displayed on a page that can be viewed by everyone.

This project was done during the course M7011E Design of Dynamic Web Systems at
Lule√• University of Technology. The project report is available as a web page at
